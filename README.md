# MediVault Webapp

The aim of the project is to store all the medical related records at a single place which would help him to access these anywhere ,anytime. Users can also keep the details of the vaccination card which tells them how many doses are due and keep the record for all the necessary vaccines.This helps the user to maintain the data and the user doesnâ€™t need to worry about keeping the vaccination card physically.
Also, one of the features of the website is that we can get data related to the vaccination drives and one can also register and publicize their vaccination camp for which users will be notified via email. Users will also get a 2 day prior email notification if any camp is available near them.
